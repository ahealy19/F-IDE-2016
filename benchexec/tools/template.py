        Returns a dict, that contains several further dicts.
        All keys and values have to be Strings!

        Note that when executing benchmarks under a separate user account (with flag --user),
        the environment of the tool is a fresh almost-empty one.
        This function can be used to set some variables.

        Note that runexec usually overrides the environment variable $HOME and sets it to a fresh
        directory. If your tool relies on $HOME pointing to the real home directory,
        you can use the result of this function to overwrite the value specified by runexec.
        This is not recommended, however, because it means that runs may be influenced
        by files in the home directory, which hinders reproducibility.

        Currently we support 3 identifiers in the outer dict:

        "keepEnv": If specified, the run gets initialized with a fresh environment and only
                  variables listed in this dict are copied from the system environment
                  (the values in this dict are ignored).
        "newEnv": Before the execution, the values are assigned to the real environment-identifiers.
                  This will override existing values.
        "additionalEnv": Before the execution, the values are appended to the real environment-identifiers.
                  The seperator for the appending must be given in this method,
                  so that the operation "realValue + additionalValue" is a valid value.
                  For example in the PATH-variable the additionalValue starts with a ":".
